    <string name="long_content">If you use MotionLayout only to do a collapsing toolbar, it might not be the most efficient solution, as MotionLayout is a powerful but relatively heavy component that can have an impact on performance.

AppBarLayout, on the other hand, is specifically designed to provide the collapsing behavior of the toolbar, and it comes with built-in scrolling behaviors and optimizations that can provide better performance.

Using MotionLayout alone may also require more effort and time to set up, as it requires defining keyframes and constraints to create the animation sequence, whereas AppBarLayout provides a simpler and more straightforward way to create a collapsing toolbar.

Moreover, using AppBarLayout instead of MotionLayout for the collapsing toolbar ensures consistency with the standard Android Material Design guidelines, which can help users navigate the app more easily.

Overall, while MotionLayout provides advanced animation capabilities, it may not be the optimal solution for implementing a collapsing toolbar. It is recommended to use the dedicated AppBarLayout component for this purpose to ensure better performance and consistency with the Material Design guidelines.</string>
